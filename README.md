# CLIENT BLOG

2. Make a new folder for your project. <br>
```
$ mkdir client-blog
```

3. Change your directory to the project folder. <br>
```
$ cd client-blog
```

4. Navigate to github.com's main page and select "Start a project". Name your project "client-blog" and select, "Create repository."

5. Connect your project folder to your github project by following the instructions given to you on github once you create the new project. 

6. Complete your project.
